  ## Description

  The Note Taker app provides a quick and easy way to make notes. This project utilizes Node and the express, FS, and uniqid modules. I created express routes that allow data in a .JSON file to be manipulated via API's. The UI code was provided ahead of time. This project concentrated on the backend.

  ## Installation

  ## Usage

  You use the app by starting the Node server, and then navigating to your app's URL. If deployed on Heroku, go to the app's URL. If deployed locally, the app will use http://localhost:3000. Then click "Get Started" and write a note! You can also test the delete function by creating new notes and deleting them.
